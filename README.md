## 🧠 Abstract

Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) demonstrate strong zero-shot performance on clinical tasks but are often miscalibrated, undermining trust in high-stakes settings.  
We propose **CalibPrompt**, the first framework that enhances Med-VLM calibration during prompt tuning by introducing two novel losses:
- **SMAC**: Smoothed Accuracy and Confidence Matching Loss
- **Angular Separation Loss**: Encourages textual feature diversity

CalibPrompt consistently improves calibration across **four Med-VLMs** (PLIP, MedCLIP, QuiltNet, BioMedCLIP) and **five medical datasets** (COVIDX, RSNA18, Kather, PanNuke, DigestPath), all while tuning only **0.1%** of model parameters.
